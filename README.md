# Session-10

## In this assigment,we are applying cutout and  using LR Finder to find the best starting learning rate. Then we are using SGD with momentum to train the model
## till 100 epoch. Finally we pick the best performing model (epoch). Then we calculate top 3 & 5 accuracy and finally perform gradcam on misclassified images.

<b> 1. Using LR finder, we get a learning of 0.1. <b>
